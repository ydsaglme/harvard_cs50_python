## Description
_This project is related with a Python-based application that facilitates the retrieval, analysis, and visualization of historical stock data using the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance). Users begin by entering a stock ticker symbol along with their desired time period for data retrieval. When the user enters an invalid ticker symbol or a time period, the program prompts them with a clear error message and exits the program. On the other hand, it retrieves the relevant historical data and saves it as a CSV file if the inputs are valid._

_The core functionality of the tool lies in its advanced data visualization capabilities powered by the _matplotlib_ library. It produces line graphs showing closing prices, trading volumes and daily returns, and histograms showing the distribution of closing prices and daily returns, among other important visualizations. To aid users in seeing trends more clearly, the tool also computes simple moving averages (SMAs) for a number of periods and overlays them on the closing price graph. Then, all visual outputs are saved as PNG files for easy access and sharing. As a result, this project will give insights for the ones that are interested in finance, data visualization and stock market analysis about the stocks that they are into._
